Description
===========

A script to use with [fzf][fzf] for previews.
Can preview arbitrary files, including videos/PDF.
Uses [kitty][kitty]'s [icat kitten][icat] to show images, but can be modified
to use other methods such as w3mimgdisplay.
Piggybacks on [ranger][ranger]'s cache directory (if present) to avoid
duplicating preview files.


Usage
=====

Download and place the script in your `$PATH`, for example:

    cd ~/.local/bin/
    wget 'https://github.com/GermainZ/fzf-preview/raw/master/fzf-preview'
    chmod +x fzf-preview

Then invoke it from fzf, for example:

    fzf --preview 'fzf-preview {}'
